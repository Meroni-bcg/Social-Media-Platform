# Social-Media-Platform
> GirlCode is an interactive React App that emerged as the culmination of our intensive coding bootcamp experience. This dynamic application serves as a testament to the extensive knowledge we have acquired over the course of the past 11 months. Inspired by the serene boho beach aesthetic, GirlCode stands out as a unique social media platform. Countless hours of dedicated effort have been poured into crafting a design that deviates from the conventional modern-day social media platforms. While the interface may bear similarities to existing layouts, we have painstakingly tailored this app to reflect our own vision. Our overarching objective is to foster a vibrant community where the talented women of the Developer World can convene, share their remarkable work, and forge connections with fellow females across the globe. GirlCode aims to unite women in this male-dominated field, showcasing their indomitable presence and ensuring their valuable contributions are acknowledged.
